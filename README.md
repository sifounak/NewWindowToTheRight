# New Window to the Right
A Chrome extension to avoid having new window open off screen or partially off screen.

This Chrome extension opens new windows directly to the right of the current window (instead of Chrome's default cascading behavior).


## Why does this matter?

Like many people, my Chrome window is always set to take the maximum vertical space on my monitor (but not the maximum horizontal space).

Unfortunately, whenever you open a new Chrome window, Chrome cascades new windows down and to the right by default. This means that every new window starts off with part of its window off screen.

That's extremely annoying! ðŸ˜¡

# What does it do?

1. **Disables cascading:**  Opens new windows directly to the right of the current window.

2. **Right edge protection:**  Protects against opening a new window having any part of its window off screen to the right. If a new window has any portion of its window off screen, the new window will open on the left side of the screen, instead.

3. **Multi-monitor support:**  New windows always fully appear on the same monitor from the window they were spawned from. (Note: The source monitor is determined by the location of the top left corner of the last focused window.) This keeps windows from opening with their window split across multiple monitors or having a window appear on a different monitor than the one you were originally working on (less mental context switching).

I hope you find this as useful as I have!

Enjoy!
